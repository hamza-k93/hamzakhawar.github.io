So in 2023, I decided to dive into AI. Why AI? Well, in my perspective, it struck the right balance\u2014technically demanding, intellectually stimulating, and full of potential. But with an overwhelming sea of resources, finding a clear path wasn\u2019t easy. So, I began documenting my journey, hoping to share it as a blueprint for others on a similar path or simply looking for a place to start.</p>"},{"location":"roadmap/#foundations","title":"Foundations","text":""},{"location":"roadmap/#programming","title":"Programming","text":"<p>As a Berkeley graduate (Go Bears!), I can\u2019t recommend CS 61A enough.

Stanford's CS231n is one of the best introductions to the topic, but the widely accessible lecture videos are from 2016\u2014now somewhat outdated given the rapid advancements in the field. I\u2019d recommend watching CS231n up to lecture 6 (backpropagation), which features some of the clearest explanations I\u2019ve found, delivered by none other than Andrej Karpathy. From there, I\u2019d suggest transitioning to Michigan's EECS 498 by Justin Johnson (one of CS231n\u2019s main instructors) for a more updated take.</p> <p>Many people find the mathematical aspects of deep learning overwhelming:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For a refresher on linear algebra and probability, I recommend the relevant sections from the foundational book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow et al. </p> </li> <li> <p>For matrix calculus, The Matrix Cookbook is an excellent resource, along with its youtube walkthroughs: Part 1 &amp; Part 2.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For supplementary information, I recommend exploring the Neural Network series by 3Blue1Brown and StatQuest.
