# Roadmap for Learning AI 


## Inspiration
Five years after graduate school, I found myself feeling stagnant, searching for a challenge that would push me beyond my comfort zone and expand my skill set. So in 2023, I decided to dive into AI. Why AI? Well, in my perspective, it struck the right balance—technically demanding, intellectually stimulating, and full of potential. But with an overwhelming sea of resources, finding a clear path wasn’t easy. So, I began documenting my journey, hoping to share it as a blueprint for others on a similar path or simply looking for a place to start.

## Foundations

#### Programming
As a Berkeley graduate (Go Bears!), I can’t recommend CS 61A enough. This course lays a solid foundation in programming, covering fundamental concepts that are essential for anyone diving into AI and beyond.
