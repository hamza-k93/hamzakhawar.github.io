# Roadmap for Learning AI 


## Inspiration
Five years after graduate school, I found myself feeling stagnant, searching for a challenge that would push me beyond my comfort zone and expand my skill set. So in 2023, I decided to dive into AI. Why AI? Well, in my perspective, it struck the right balance—technically demanding, intellectually stimulating, and full of potential. But with an overwhelming sea of resources, finding a clear path wasn’t easy. So, I began documenting my journey, hoping to share it as a blueprint for others on a similar path or simply looking for a place to start.

## Foundations

## Progress Update

#### 2 Year Update
As I approach the two-year mark on this journey, I’ve come to appreciate the daily challenge of learning, embracing the opportunity to stretch my intellectual boundaries and grow. I continue to find immense value in understanding the state of the art—how AI is driving breakthroughs, solving complex problems, and unlocking new possibilities across industries. What started as a way to push myself has evolved into a long-term commitment to staying at the forefront of AI, continuously learning, and evolving alongside it. I now see myself becoming a bridge between business and technology, combining strategic thinking with cutting-edge AI innovation. The journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m excited to see where it takes me in the years ahead.
