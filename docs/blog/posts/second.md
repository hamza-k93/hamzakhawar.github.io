As I approach the two-year mark on this journey, I’ve come to appreciate the daily challenge of learning, embracing the opportunity to stretch my intellectual boundaries and grow. I continue to find immense value in understanding the state of the art—how AI is driving breakthroughs, solving complex problems, and unlocking new possibilities across industries. What started as a way to push myself has evolved into a long-term commitment to staying at the forefront of AI, continuously learning, and evolving alongside it. I now see myself becoming a bridge between business and technology, combining strategic thinking with cutting-edge AI innovation. The journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m excited to see where it takes me in the years ahead.
